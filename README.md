# SLIC Image Segmentation Comparison Tool

This tool compares different SLIC image segmentation methods using the Streamlit library. The user can adjust the parameters for the SLIC algorithm and see the resulting segmentation in real-time. The program also adds each superpixel segment into an array for further analysis or processing.
